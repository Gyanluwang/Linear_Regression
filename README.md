# Linear_Regression: USA House-Price Prediction

#Predicting house prices using Linear Regression 

Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for him that allows him to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

He has asked you if you could help him out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!

Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.

# Data Description:
The data contains the following columns:

* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
